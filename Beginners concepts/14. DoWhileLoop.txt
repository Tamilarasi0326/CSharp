//The loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested.
//the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (i) is less than 5:

using System;

namespace doWhileLoop
{
    class program14
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int i = 0;
            do
            {
                Console.WriteLine(i);
                i++;
            }while(i < 5);
        }
    }
}
